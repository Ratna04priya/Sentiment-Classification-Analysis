# Sentiment-Classification-Analysis
**Sentiment Classification Framing Problems for a Neural Network.**

_Sentiment Analysis examines the problem of studying texts, like posts and reviews, uploaded by users on microblogging platforms, forums, and electronic businesses, regarding the opinions they have about a product, service, event, person or idea._

The most common use of Sentiment Analysis is this of classifying a text to a class. Depending on the dataset and the reason, Sentiment Classification can be binary (positive or negative) or multi-class (3 or more classes) problem.

In addition, among researchers and stakeholders, you can find either similar or completely different opinions concerning the relation between emotion detection and sentiment analysis, depending on their perspective. However, regardless the result or approach, they all adopt the same techniques.

## Analysis of a Neural Network.

The analysis is divided into sub projects -

## 1. Perparation of Dataset
### Curate a Dataset

The data in reviews.txt we're using has already been preprocessed a bit and contains only lower case characters. If we were working from raw data, where we didn't know it was all lower case, we would want to add a step here to convert it. That's so we treat different variations of the same word, like The, the, and THE, all the same way.

### Develop a Predictive Theory

By labelling and assigning the corrosponding reviews with it.
